      "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—",
      "the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures",
      "regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David,",
      "and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.",
      "And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.",
      "To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.",
      "God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you",
      "in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.",
      "I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong—",
      "that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.",
      "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.",
      "I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.",
      "That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.",
      "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.",
      "For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed — a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'",
      "The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,",
      "since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.",
      "For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.",
      "For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.",
      "Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools",
      "and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.",
      "Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.",
      "They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator — who is forever praised. Amen.",
      "Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.",
      "In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.",
      "Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.",
      "They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,",
      "slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;",
      "they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.",
      "Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.",

      "You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.",
      "Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.",
      "So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?",
      "Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?",
      "But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.",
      "God 'will repay each person according to what they have done.'",
      "To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.",
      "But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.",
      "There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;",
      "but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.",
      "For God does not show favoritism.",
      "All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.",
      "For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.",
      "Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.",
      "They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.",
      "This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.",
      "Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;",
      "if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;",
      "if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,",
      "an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—",
      "you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?",
      "You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?",
      "You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?",
      "As it is written: 'God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.'",
      "Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.",
      "So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?",
      "The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.",
      "A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.",
      "No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God.",

      "What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?",
      "Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God.",
      "What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness?",
      "Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: 'So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.'",
      "But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)",
      "Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?",
      "Someone might argue, 'If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?'",
      "Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—'Let us do evil that good may result'? Their condemnation is just!",
      "What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin.",
      "As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even one;",
      "there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.",
      "All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.'",

      "'There is no fear of God before their eyes.'",
      "Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.",
      "Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.",
      "But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.",
      "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,",
      "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,",
      "and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.",

      "What does Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.'",
      "Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation.",
      "However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.",

      "Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.",
      "Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!",
      "And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.",
      "And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.",
      "It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.",
      "For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless,",
      "because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.",
      "Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.",
      "As it is written: 'I have made you a father of many nations.' He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not.",
      "Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, 'So shall your offspring be.'",
      "Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead.",
      "Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,",
      "being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.",

      "You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.",
      "I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness.",
      "When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.",
      "What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!",
      "But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.",
      "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.",

    verses: [
      "Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives?",
      "For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him.",
      "So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.",
      "So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.",
      "For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death.",
      "But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.",
      "What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, 'You shall not covet.'",
      "But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead.",
      "Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.",
      "I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.",
      "For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.",
      "So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.",
      "Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.",
      "We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.",
      "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.",
      "And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.",
      "As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.",
      "For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.",
      "For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.",
      "Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.",
      "So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.",
      "For in my inner being I delight in God’s law;",
      "but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.",
      "What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?",
      "Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.",

      "To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ — their Lord and ours:",
      "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.",
      "For in him you have been enriched in every way — with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge—",
      "God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you.",
      "Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.",
      "He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
      "God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",
      "I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.",
      "My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.",
      "What I mean is this: One of you says, 'I follow Paul'; another, 'I follow Apollos'; another, 'I follow Cephas'; still another, 'I follow Christ.'",
      "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?",
      "I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
      "so no one can say that you were baptized in my name.",
      "Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.",
      "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel — not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.",
      "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.",
      "For it is written: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.'",
      "Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?",
      "For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.",
      "Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,",
      "but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,",
      "but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
      "For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.",
      "Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.",
      "But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.",
      "God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things — and the things that are not — to nullify the things that are,",
